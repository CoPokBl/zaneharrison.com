      <h1>My Projects</h1>
      <p class="lead">
        Here are some projects I have worked on, all the open source ones will have GitHub links. Please be aware that some of these will suck, a lot of the projects here were made a while ago back
        when I wasn't as good at programming and don't reflect my current skill. If you want to know how good I currently am then look at projects
        with recent commits on GitHub (this year preferably). They are ordered with the most recently worked on ones first.

          <h2>EsTools</h2>
          <p>
            A general purpose Minecraft Spigot/CraftBukkit plugin inspired by EssentialsX but is designed to not override any default Minecraft commands
            and is more lightweight and simple. It supports every version from 1.3 to 1.18 which is every single downloadable Bukkit version. This is my
            project but had a lot of work done by a friend of mine.

          <h2>Ultimate UHC</h2>
          <p>
            Ultimate UHC is an Ultra Hardcore competition plugin for Minecraft Spigot/CraftBukkit, it was one of my first plugins and recently I came back
            to it and completely refactored it (Literally all the code was in one class). This plugin allows you to host UHC games in 1.8-1.18
            (I only tested 1.8 and 1.17 but it should work).

          <h2>Better Combat</h2>
          <p>
            Better Combat is a Minecraft Spigot/CraftBukkit plugin designed to improve 1.16 combat (although it works on most modern versions).
            This plugin is very old and is badly made but due to me losing interest in latest version combat I stopped updating it.

          <h2>Homework Tracker Server</h2>
          <p>
            This is an ASP.NET API project designed to allow users to save homework tasks on a server and access it on any device.
            This is just the server part of the project, I also made a client in Unity (I know it sounds really scuffed). This project
            was important because it was how I learned a lot about HTTP and ASP.NET, it was originally made using the TcpListener object
            in C#. This project is also when I learned a bit more about git and started using it better.
            One big issue with it is that it doesn't have HTTPS support. I am hosting an instance of the server at
            <a href="https://homeworktrack.serble.net:9897/">homeworktrack.serble.net:9897</a> and it is currently <b id="homeworkServerStatus">Loading Server Status...</b>.

          <h2>Homework Tracker Unity Client</h2>
          <p>
            This is a client for the above server. It's made in Unity which is a game engine, yeah I know it's dumb and bad but it was the
            easiest way for me to make a simple client. I literally just made this to test the Homework Tracker Server but it's not bad.
